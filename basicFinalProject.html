          four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal,
          thank you very much. They were the last people you'd expect to be
          involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn't
          hold with such nonsense.
          <br />
          <br />
          Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made
          drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did
          have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had
          nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as
          she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on
          the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their
          opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.
          <br />
          <br />
          The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret,
          and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They
          didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the
          Potters...
